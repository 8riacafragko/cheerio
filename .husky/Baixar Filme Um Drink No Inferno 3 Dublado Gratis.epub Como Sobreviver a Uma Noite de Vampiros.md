These mechanisms are designed to prevent unauthorized use of the software and to verify its authenticity. Chew-WGA works by disabling or modifying certain components of the software protection platform, which is a set of technologies and services that enforce the Windows licensing system. One of the components that Chew-WGA restricts access to is sppcomapi.dll file, which is responsible for activating, validating and detecting tampering of Windows. In addition, Chew-WGA also patches many other files that are related to the software protection platform.

Chew-WGA is one of the many Windows 7 cracks that have been developed by hackers and software pirates to circumvent the Windows activation process. The activation process is a feature that was introduced in Windows XP and later versions to reduce software piracy and counterfeiting. It requires users to enter a valid product key and activate their copy of Windows online or by phone within a grace period. If the activation fails or is not done within the grace period, the system will enter a reduced functionality mode, where some features will be disabled or limited.
  
However, Chew-WGA and other similar cracks can fool the activation process and make the system think that it is genuine and activated. This way, users can enjoy the full functionality of Windows 7 without paying for a license or following the activation procedure. Chew-WGA claims to be a "solution with zero risk of bricking your boot sector or rendering your PC unbootable". It also claims to be compatible with all editions of Windows 7, both 32-bit and 64-bit.
  
While Chew-WGA may seem to be a convenient and easy way to use Windows 7 for free, it also comes with some risks and disadvantages. First of all, using Chew-WGA is illegal and violates the terms of service of Microsoft. Users who use Chew-WGA may face legal consequences or penalties from Microsoft or other authorities. Second, using Chew-WGA may expose the system to security vulnerabilities and malware infections, as Chew-WGA modifies system files and disables security updates. Third, using Chew-WGA may cause system instability and performance issues, as Chew-WGA interferes with the normal functioning of the software protection platform and other system components.
